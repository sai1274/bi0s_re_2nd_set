i used gdb to debug.
gdb crackme0x0b
then i gave the command info functions i found a function "wcscmp@plt"
so i thought that my is being passed into that functions as argument
and then my input is being compared with the required string.
Initially i gave a random key then first letter of my key is being compared with
'w'. With that thing i found that other letters of the string.


Or you can try this method since our input is being compared with a
string which is already stored in the source code. So try to dump them
using the command 
	"objdump -s -j .data filename"
