This challenge is simlar to crackme0x02 but the difference is our input
is being passed into function named test there it's being compared with
the number 338724.
If it's correct this statement will be printed "Sdvvzrug#RN$$$#=,"
This is a cipher text this statement goes under function shift and shifts 
+3 and prints Password OK!!! :)
